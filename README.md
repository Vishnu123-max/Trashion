System Description:

Homepage
In order to build a homepage, we utilise HTML, CSS, Javascript to build a page fully developed
which can showcase our website’s integrity as well as purpose. This will also ensure that a large
number of users are attracted to buy recycled products as this will directly influence our sales and
the environmental impact as such.

Registration and Login
The registration and login pages are fully equipped with JS to check the validity of the data that
user is entering. These pages are connected to the database which will ensure that the data is being
securely recorded.

Product Display
The website will be built keeping in mind environmental issues that we are facing due to the usage
of different plastic and other chemically products to fulfil our basic requirements. To avoid the
harm, we are causing to our ecosystem we are developing this site which will sell products that are
eco-friendly, recycled products. User can browse through our inventory system, he\she can
purchase products which are available through our local craftsmen and retailers who make products
out of the recycled ones. Thus, our site boosts local businesses and also helps us to tackle
environmental hazards by transforming waste products to a newly adaptable and re-usable
products.

Cart
Once user finished browsing products, he\she can add the item to the cart, where the shopping cart
function should display all the product descriptions added by user to the shopping cart. While
displaying the product, it should get the product availability from inventory system and product
price from pricing system to display the availability and pricing information. It should allow the
user to check out the products in shopping cart. In payment, we are providing two choices i.e. to
use normal payment methods or they can use points\cashback which they have from previous
transactions.

Donation Page
Our site is also providing options to recycle their waste products and in return they will be granted
points\cashback offers to their account. They can use this points to avail discounts on their next
purchase. User fills the details about the type of waste\product, they want to donate and according
to the type or usage points or offers will be avail to their next purchase. Thus, we are helping to
reduce wastage, by providing people a platform to recycle waste products.



Payment Gateway
We intend to use Paytm API to integrate a testing payment environment in our application. This
will ensure that our website is end to end fully completed with a payment option available for the
users to pay and buy the products.
There are three sections in this project. The first one is the online store where only recycled products
will be displayed for purchase. In this section, the products will be segregated into different
categories and sub-categories. Functionalities such as search, add to cart and others as mentioned
before, will be provided to the customers. The second section is the waste collection module. Here,
users can fill the details about the type of waste they wish to recycle and in return points/cashback
offers will get added to their account which they can use for buying products from the online store.
The third module is the ‘plant a tree’. In this, users can purchase any plant they wish to grow. For
the database, we will manually add products (names, images and data of products) in our MySQL.
